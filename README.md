`morphoHeart` is an open source software for segmentation and morphometric analysis of bioimages, intended for research use only. It is an exciting alternative to free and commercially available software, offering a comprehensive pipeline that provides semi-automated segmentation capabilities and improves the suite of tools and quantifications available in the biological field to characterise organ morphology and tissue distribution.
